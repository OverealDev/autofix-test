# autoreload.fix
Provides two solutions to refresh a Shiny App. 

The `options(shiny.autoreload = TRUE)` automatically refreshes a Shiny app, however it comes with an issue. When working with multiple files (outside of app.R) the UI isnt refreshed properly. For instance, when working with modules or a `golem` you have to reboot the app in order to see UI changes.  

This package provides two workarounds by updating the `file.mtime` of app.R when a file in /R folder is updated or added (e.g., the latest `file.mtime` of this folder changes)  
1) refresh(): Creates an addin for manual refreshing  
2) autorefresh(): Runs a seperate shiny app that automatically refreshes your main app


## Install
`devtools::install_github("https://github.com/vreederene-90/autoreload.fix")`  

## Global option needed for both options  
`options(shiny.autoreload = TRUE)`  

## Refresh  
After installation an Addin is added, which makes it possible to make a shortcut to the function `autoreload.fix::refresh()`. For example, you can bind it to F5. When executed, it refreshes the app. It is assumed your "app.R" file is in the project root. 

So in practice this means you start up your app in a external sesion (e.g., terminal or job) and after saving your edited script in the /R folder you press the binded key.

## Autorefresh
A Shiny app is started with `autoreload.fix::autorefresh()` that watches the /R folder and updates automatically when the `file.mtime` changes of the files in the /R folder.  
It is needed to run this function (and your actual app) via a terminal session (e.g., `R -e "autoreload.fix::autorefresh()"`) from the root of the project folder. Otherwise this wont work.
